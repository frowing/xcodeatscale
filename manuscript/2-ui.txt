# User interface

User interface is the entry point in our apps. It's what the users see and interact with. Interfaces are composable and what users see on the screen is a composition of multiple views that are composed in armony to fit into your project brand. There are views that don't respond to actions, plain views, or views that respond to acttions, buttons. In iOS development all these elements come from `UIKit`, a system framework that uses inheritance to provide you with elements that you can use for your projects. `UIKit` is also the framework used for watchOS and tvOS applications. In this case the framework introduces some changes since the UX of these platform differs to the iOS one, but most of APIs are similar. That makes things easier to iOS developers that want jump into these platform with their experience on iOS.

On macOS things are a little bit different. There's no `UIKit` but instead there's `AppKit`. Since this framework was there before iOS APIs and components are a lot more different. For example, `UIResponder` chain that is not used a lot on iOS, is commonly used there. Self-contained views on iOS, such as `UITextView`s turn into a composition of multiple views on macOS, in essence, the view with the text, and the one that handles the scrolling.

For any of these aforementioned platforms, we can use a tool from Xcode, Interface Builder, for building our UIs. As you might know, IB is a drag-and-drop tool that allows you to build UIs by dragging and dropping elements, setting their properties, sizes and constraints, and connecting them with your code via `@IB...` properties. XIBs and Storyboards are the files IB works with. Storyboards go one step further and allows you to define also the navigation of your app, connecting different ViewControllers and defining how the navigation should be between them.

Moreover, UIs can also be built in code. Whatever you do in IB, you can do it in code! *(but not the other way around)*. You can implement everything in code using `UIKit` and lower leverl APIs, or do something hybrid, where some elements are defined in an IB file and you connect them with some elements that you have defined in code. This a very polemic topic and a usual discussion point among developers.

- How do you describe your UI?
- Do you use XIBs or Storyboards?

Any of them is better than the other. But although Apple is trying its best to add more functionalities to IB, there are still things that you can't do from there. Some examples could be animations, or interact with Core Animation properties. That leads you to define part of the UI using IB and the other one in code. The *'source of truth'*, is not in a single place anymore but spread in two, or more files. Have you ever been in that situation where you didn't get the expected UI on the device, although the IB showed you what you wanted to achieve? Most likely you were modifying something from code that you didn't expect.

Having the source of truth in terms of UI spread across different files might eventually lead you to these kind of issues, that are sometimes hard to debug. *Why the size is not correct?*, *Why the font is not the one that I'm expecting?*. Nevertheless, having the UI in code makes it harder to understand how the view in code looks like. When you have your UI in an IB file, you can see how it looks like at a glance by just opening the file.

Deciding between IB or views in code is a decision you take when you start a new project. Sometimes it comes from a personal preference. Both of them have pros and cons, and they way you design there we'll have an impact on the scalability of them. Let's dive into scalability UI-related issues that might arise, reason about them, and come up with alternatives or tips to decrease the negative impact they have in your project.

## Interface Builder (IB) files

IB uses internally a custom xml-like representation for your UI. Whenever you modify something, it updates the internal representation to match what you see on the IB. While you can update the file manually with a text editor, it's not very human-readable. Let me ask you a question..

> In how many pull requests that you have reviewed, you did spend time reviewing the changes in these files? Things like, the size, the constraints, colors...

I dare to say most times you don't. But that's fine, we trust each other, our relationship with designers, and we trust our snapshot testing suite. But what if two teams are modifying the same file in two different branches? Then you'll have a big trouble. As soon as one of you have to rebase on the other's branch, you'll have to deal with the conflicts. And you might guess, this time you have dive into that plain-text representation.

The more complex the layout is, the harder it'll be to figure out the conflicts and solve them. Even if you manage to solve them, how do you make sure that the conflicts were solved correctly? You can ask designers to do eye-check, or validate the snapshot with them, so that you can use it in your snapshot testing infrastructure.

In any case, you'll need constant checks, and that slows down your team's workflow. That's not good! Let's dive into some tips and ideas to prevent these issues and in case they happen make them easier to solve.

### Simplicity

The first time you create an IB file, either a XIB file or a Storyboard, you find yourself with a white canvas where you can start drawing like a painter. I drag this view there, then this button, I set some constraints, change the color of this view. Unless you control this process, you might end up with a huge complex layout, like the one shown below:

{alt: "complex layout defined in an interface file"}
![An example of a complex layout where it's hard to figure out how the layout looks like](images/xib_complex_layout.png)

In politics, sociology, and economics, **divide and conquer** refers to a strategy to gain or maintain power. By dividing and conquering in IB files we'll gain and maintain scalability. Define your UI to be component driven, where larger views are built by composing smaller UI pieces. Instead of having a single IB that holds all the subviews and possible use cases, split it up in different IB files.

{class: aside}
{blurb}
For example, let's say that you have a music player view, defined in a XIB file. The view controller contains the metadata, navigation, and control subviews. By adding all these sub-elements to the XIB file, you increase the complexity, and limit the reusability of these sub-elements. *What if you wanted to use the controls subview with another view controller?* *What if you wanted to reuse the navigation?* Instead of grouping all of them in the same interface file, create the following components:

- `Navigation{.swift,.xib}`
- `PlayerControlsView{.swift,.xib}`
- `PlayerMetadataView{.swift,.xib}`
- `PlayerViewController{.swift,.xib}`

Each of these sub-elements will be simple, will contain its logic for formatting and positioning. And in case they need to be hooked from outside. They'll provide an interface, that you can call from outside.

```swift
class PlayerMetadataView {

  // MARK: - Private
  // Private elements that you don't need to expose

  // MARK: - internal
  func set(trackName: String, trackArtist: String) {
    nameLabel.text = trackName
    artistLabel.ext = trackArtist
  }
}
```

### Readability

When vies are dragged and dropped into the interface file, they are named with their class by default: `UIView`, `UIButton`... If the UI is simple, having these names might be fine to understand which one is each of them referring to. Nevertheless, as soon as you start having more than one `UIView`, or more than one `UIButton`, you'll need some time to figure out who they are.

**Be explicit and set the label property to your subviews**. The two images below show one example without names, and another example with names. Which one is easier to understand?

{alt: "a view whose subviews are not named"}
![View interface file with the subviews without names](images/xib_without_titles.png)

{alt: "a view whose subviews are named"}
![View interface file with the subviews with names](images/xib_with_titles.png)

{class: tip}
{blurb}
Remember, you can easily change the label in the *Identity Inspector* as shown in the image below:

{alt: "the identity inspector view with the field to update the label"}
![Identity inspector with the field to update the view label](images/identity_inspector_label.png)
{/blurb}

> Whenever you add a new element to the interface, go to the inspector properties, and assign a label that identifies what the element is doing.

### Reusability

Reusability it's another common issue when building UIs. You might end up in a situation where a similar layout is defined in different places. You should aim for reusable UIs like you do with your code. When you have your project duplicated layouts, it increases the maintainability costs, and also the inconsistency risks. At some point, designers might ask you for update one view in the app to include an extra element, and since you didn't know the layout was duplicated in other parts of the app, you forget about it. The introduced element is not consistent across the app.

As a first exercise to do when you are about adding a new view to the app, make sure there isn't any other similar layout that you can reuse. If there is, you should use that one instead. If the layout is not in place, and you need to work on a new one, you should commit to make the layout reusable. **How can you make your component reusable?**

- Don't tie its API to any use case, and thus, to any model. The component should take the data that it needs to present itself, generally `Foundation`, `UIKit` and `AppKit` types, like `String`, `Bool`, `UIImage`...
- If the APIs of your view takes a lot of parameters, you can define the view model that your view accepts, and pass all the properties creating a view model that you pass to the view.

{caption: "Example of cell view that has a presentation method that takes as input parameters all the data that it needs for the presentation."}
```swift
class TrackCellView {
  func present(trackTitle: String, trackArtist: String, isDownloading: Bool, duration: String, artworkUrl: URL, isLiked: Bool) {
    // Presentation logic
  }
}
```
{caption: "An alternative would be defining a view model that you can pass to the view. The view would read the properties from the view model that you are passing"}
```swift
struct TrackCellViewModel {
  let trackTitle: String
  let trackArtist: String
  let isDownloading: Bool
  let duration: String
  let artworkUrl: URL
  let isLiked: Bool
}
```
It might happen that two layouts that were similar at the beginning, started to differ and you ended up with a view model full of boolean properties that would conditionally define multiple states for your cell. In that case, it makes sense to consider separating the layouts. Since you don't want to duplicate part of the layout that you have already defined you can:

- Use **inheritance**. You can inherit the base view and add the additional functionality that differs from the two layouts. That would violate the Liskov SOLID principle because you'll end up with a subclass that cannot be interchanged with its parent class. By subclassing you open the door to extend APIS as you need, and as the project evolves, these subclasses will most likely be extended to satisfy product needs.
- Use **composition**. With composition you can abstract the reusable elements from your layout *(if there's any)*, and create a view with them. That way you can easily compose it into the two layouts, and add the extra functionality that each of them needs.

Component-driven layouts is a trend nowadays. A lot of companies and projects are moving towards approaches where where layouts are built by composing components. Solutions are coming out for different platforms:
- [**React**](https://facebook.github.io/react/) from Facebook, where components defined with Javascript and HTML.
- [**React Native**](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) also from Facebook, where components are defined in Javascript and are rendered as native code *(Java for Android and Objective-C for iOS)*. Companies like [Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/) or [Instagram]() are moving towards this solution. We'll cover the reasons later in this book.
- [**Hub Framework**](https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework) from Spotify where native components are composed in collections. How these components are arranged and built can be defined in a JSON file that can be sent from a backend. At Spotify they call it [Backend Driven UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypk-72mhYBk)
- [**IGListKit**](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit) from Instagram that provides an abstraction layer on top of `UICollectionView`.
- [**ComponentKit**](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1415586422080360/introducing-componentkit-functional-and-declarative-ui-on-ios/) also from Facebook that allows you focus on what your UI should look like, rather than on the steps necessary to build it. It's a functional approach.

### Declarative UIs

A good alternative to IB files is defining the UI in code. A few years ago, UI written in code was pretty hard to understand. When autolayouts were introduced, the APIs to define constraints in code weren't very readable. Developers preferred to use IB instead. Fortunatelly, this has changed and Apple has introduced a lot of improvements in these APIs and nowadays, it's very easy to figure out how the UI looks like by reading the definition in code. Let's look at the example below:

```swift
button.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: 15).isActive = true
button.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor, constant: -15).isActive = true
button.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor, constant: -15).isActive = true
button.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 44).isActive = true
```

Could you imagine how the view will look like? Easy, right? If you design your application views to be no more than 5 views, the layouting code shouldn't be that complex. Moreover, by doing everything in code, you make sure there's a single source of truth regarding the UI. You can, not only position the elements, but define how they animate, how they react to changes, or how your app navigates between different views.

Conflicts are easier to solve with declarative UIs since there isn't an internal representation other than the code that you write and that people in your team understand. It's your language!

If you don't like the APIs that were given by `UIKit` or `AppKit` you can try any of the libraries mentioned before, they provide you with a custom syntax for defining your app. There are some others out there like [MarkupKit](https://github.com/gk-brown/MarkupKit) with which you can define the user interface in a XML file or [LeeGo](https://github.com/wangshengjia/LeeGo) where you can describe your whole UI in small pieces of Lego style's bricks.

{class: warning}

Depending on third party libraries comes with a downside, maintainance. If the library introduces breaking changes, or the language does, your project will get stuck in a particular version and you'll need to spend some time to bump the dependency version.

## Navigation

As you might now, on Apple platforms the navigation is not centralized. To navigate to a different view, you have to do it from the existing view, presenting, pushing... While it works for simple navigation model, it doesn't scale when the model becomes more complex. Moreover the fact that the navigation is not centralized, brings some complexity when deep links handling logic.

For example, when a notification is received, or the user is trying to continue its navigation within your app using a deep link, the app could be in a state that we have to first, have a representation about, and then decide what to do based on that state. We easily end up with a component that dives into the navigation stack, and by reverse-engineering, decides how to navigate. The problem with that model is that is by any chance, anyone in the team updates the navigation stack, and forgets about updating this component, your deep link controller will most likely get broken.
Adding up to the problem, there are so many possible scenarios regarding deep linking that it's really hard to test all of them with UI tests.

### Simplicity

Most scalability issues are solved by aiming for simplicity. In case of navigation, this will lead us to some fights with the designers in our project. It's very important to get a heads-up on the importance of simple navigations. They might think about a multi-level navigation, where all kind of transitions are possible, pushing, custom, modal, tabbar... Your project's navigation model would look like this:

![An example of how an application navigation would look like with different levels of presentation](images/navigation_hierarchy.png)

Each of these view controllers represents a **navigation state** in your app. As you can see, the combinations of these states can be infinite. Unless you define the scope for these combinations, the navigation can get out of control. Define the levels of navigation that you plan to support and commit to these.

### Coordinators

Even with the navigation simplified, it can be hard to figure out the navigation of our app. In platforms like Android, they register all the views, or `Activities` how they call it, in a central place called `Manifest`. You can register activities there with the URL that they are able to handle, and some other properties that tell the system how they should be reused. Although it sounds a good solution that we could replicate in our Xcode projects, that model works well on Android, where the navigation is mostly static. The system replaces the activity with the new one, in the same way you could do it on iOS by updating the `rootViewController` of your application `UIWindow`. Android recently introduced features to make it more dynamic, but they keep the same centralized model. 

There's a pattern, introduced by [Soroush Khanlou](http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/) for iOS called [**Coordinator Patter**](http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/). The pattern is inspired in [the application controller pattern](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/applicationController.html). The patterns states that the navigation in the app should be managed by classes called coordinators. These coordinators are responsible for *initializing* and *presenting* view controllers, and responding to actions that imply navigation by using other coordinators. A coordinator would look like:

```swift
protocol Coordinator: class {
  var childCoordinators: [Coordinator] { get }
  func start()
}
``` 
Coordinators have a reference to their children, so that they are not released from memory. Coordinators can delegate to their parent coordinator by using the delengate pattern between them. When the method `start` gets called, the view to be presented is initialized and presenter in the context the coordinator is given.

The benefits of the pattern are perfectly described by Soroush:

> The benefits to extracting the flow into a coordinator are myriad. View controllers now can focus on their goal of binding a model to a view. The can be reused more easily, such as in extensions or unbundled apps, without having complex conditionals to manage different contexts. A/B testing is as simple as creating a different coordinator object and using that to start the process. Flow logic now has a home, and things that have a home feel real nice.

{class: aside}
{blurb}
If you use [VIPER](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/) in your apps, the coordinator would be the equivalent to the `Router`.
{/blurb}

You can read more about the coordinator pattern in the following links:

- [Coordinators Redux](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/)
- [Navigation Coordinators](http://irace.me/navigation-coordinators)
- [Swift Coordinator](http://skyefreeman.io/programming/2016/02/23/playing_with_app_coordinators.html)
- [Protocol oriented app coordinator](http://mattwyskiel.github.io/posts/2016/03/20/protocol-oriented-app-coordinator-swift.html)

Coordinators need a navigation context to navigate from. It can be the source view controller *(the one the coordinator navigates from)* or it can be the view controller and other elements that allow the coordinator navigating dynamically, for example using `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`

- It should be able to navigate using `URLs`, so that we could easily handle deep links or content coming from notifications.


{class: aside}
{blurb}
You can find third party libraries like [RLDNavigationSwift](https://github.com/rlopezdiez/RLDNavigationSwift). It is a set of Swift classes which allow you to decouple navigation from view controllers, using navigation command objects to define the possible navigation flows of your app.
